## Debugging Perl

* Perl has been around since 1987
* Large amounts of legacy Perl code
* Reputation as a write-only language
* To work with Perl you will need to flex your debugging capabilities

</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Traditional Debugging

* print or say statements
    * print "I've reached this spot in my code.\n";
    * print "I should not have reached this spot in the code.\n";
* print Dumper(\%big_hash);

</section>

## Logging

* Logging is invaluable to troubleshooting applications.
* Libraries like [Log::Log4perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log::Log4perl) provide a lot of logging functionality
    * Level based log messages such as trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
    * Configurable outside of your perl code
* Logging Dumper calls is suggested

## Perl Debugger

* Sometimes you just want a little bit more power in your troubleshooting arsenal.
* perl -d script.pl
    * s - step into the next line of code
    * n - step over the next line of code
    * b - set a break point
    * c - continue to break point
    * x - dump variable
    * p - print variable
    * h - help

## Perl Debugger Tricks

* $DB::single = 1;
* mojolicious - debugs just fine at the commandline if you use perl -d to start your server
* [mod_perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Apache::DB)
